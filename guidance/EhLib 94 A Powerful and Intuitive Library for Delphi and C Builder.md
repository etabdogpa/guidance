EhLib 9.4 is not only a library of components, but also a framework that allows you to create your own custom components based on the existing ones. You can inherit from the base classes of EhLib and override their methods and properties to suit your needs. You can also use the events and interfaces provided by EhLib to customize the behavior and appearance of your components.
 
One of the most powerful features of EhLib 9.4 is the ability to use expressions in various properties of the components. Expressions are strings that can contain constants, variables, operators, functions, and references to other components or fields. Expressions can be used to dynamically calculate or modify the values of properties at runtime. For example, you can use expressions to define the color, font, alignment, visibility, or content of a grid cell based on some conditions.
 
EhLib 9.4 also supports data-aware controls that can automatically display and edit data from a data source. Data-aware controls can be linked to a TDataSet or a TMemTableEh component using a TDataSource component. Data-aware controls can handle various data types, such as strings, numbers, dates, times, booleans, images, memos, and blobs. Data-aware controls can also perform data validation and formatting using the properties and events of EhLib.
