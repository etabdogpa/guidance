Taiko drums have a long and rich history in Japan, dating back to ancient times. According to Japanese folklore, taiko drums were created by the gods to scare away evil spirits and bring peace and harmony to the land. Taiko drums were also used in religious ceremonies, festivals, warfare, court music and theater. Taiko drums have a variety of shapes, sizes and sounds, depending on their purpose and origin. Some of the most common types of taiko drums are odaiko (large barrel-shaped drums), nagado daiko (long-bodied drums), shime daiko (small rope-tied drums) and katsugi okedo daiko (portable shoulder drums).
 
Today, taiko drums are widely popular around the world, especially in the genre of kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming). Kumi-daiko was developed in the 1950s by Daihachi Oguchi, a jazz drummer who adapted traditional taiko rhythms and techniques to create modern compositions for multiple drummers. Kumi-daiko groups often combine taiko drums with other instruments, such as bamboo flutes, gongs, cymbals and vocals. Kumi-daiko performances are characterized by their dynamic energy, rhythmic complexity and visual appeal. Some of the most famous kumi-daiko groups are Kodo, Ondekoza and TaikoProject.

- Taiko drumming is a full-body workout that burns calories, strengthens muscles, improves posture and enhances cardiovascular health. Taiko drumming requires you to use your arms, shoulders, core, legs, glutes and back muscles to strike the drums with power and precision.

- Taiko drumming is a stress reliever that releases tension, boosts your mood and promotes relaxation. Taiko drumming allows you to express your emotions through sound and movement, which can help you vent out negative feelings and channel them into positive energy. Taiko drumming also triggers the release of endorphins, the natural painkillers and mood enhancers of the body. Taiko drumming can also lower your blood pressure, heart rate and cortisol levels, which are associated with stress.
